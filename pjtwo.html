    <h1>HAF-XM</h1>
    <p>
        First impressions are mixed – fair play to Cooler Master for sticking with the industrial design, which is sure to delight some but put off others. It’s actually more restrained than previous HAF cases, although there’s still an awful lot of black plastic covering the top and front of the case. It is at least all reasonably sturdy and doesn’t flex under pressure. The entire front panel is removable, and there’s a good chance you’ll be doing so on a regular basis – the 5.25in drive bay covers are held in place with flimsy plastic clips, which are easily dislodged when picking up the case from the front. The only way to get them back in place is to remove the front panel, as well as the two hot-swap 3.5in drive caddies.
