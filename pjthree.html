    <h1>Graphite 760T</h1>
    <p>
The Graphite 760T can be a little pricey, but it's a sturdy chassis loaded to the gills with features that make assembly and servicing it a breeze, and it looks great to boot.

Ultimately, the case tends to be one of two places users will cut corners on their budget (the other being the power supply), but you can actually lose system performance this way if youâ€™re not careful. As with every other component in your build, a good case is an investment. Spending up on a case that includes dust filters will make the computer much easier to maintain; grommets and mounting holes in the motherboard tray allow for better cable management which in turn makes the interior look nicer but also substantially improves airflow. Conveniences like toolless drive sleds and optical drive clamps can not only make the initial assembly much easier, they can make servicing or upgrading the computer later on a breeze.
